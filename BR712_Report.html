<em>B-16738, EVA Air Boeing 777-300ER</em></p>
<br />
<h2 id="checkin">Lounge</h2>
<p>There are 5 hours to spend after arriving into Taipei from Chicago. Most time are spent in the famous
EVA Air lounge. Since the next trip is only in Economy class, I was offered to use the Star for gold members.</p>
<p>There are four lounges operated by EVA Air. The Star is for gold members (including star gold), the Infinity
is for Business / First class passengers. These two shares the same entrance with the Star on the left side, 
and the Infinity on the right. There are also the Club for EVA Air silver members (not star silver, but star gold
can also use this one), and the Garden for EVA Air diamond members (only their own highest tier members can use this one).</p>

<p class="img">

<em>The entrance to the Star and the Infinity looks very cool.</em></p>
<p>Since the flight arrived very early, there is only a few people in lounge. However, the dining
area is ready with a wide range of selections. Since I just had breakfast on the flight, I didn't 
eat a lot.

<p>There are more and more people coming in after 7am but it is not hard to find a seat. Overall, this is a top-level 
lounge with great food selections.</p>
<h2 id="boarding">Boarding</h2>
<p>
I started moving to the gate at 9:15 to make sure I'm on the first group to board the plane. It is a full flight with 
10 seats per row in economy, so there will be trouble finding a space in luggage rack if boarding too late.
</p>
<p>
Soon after seated, a cabin attendant brought the bag of duty free items I preordered online. This is when I realized 
the Hello Kitty bags seen on the Chicago flight was for duty free. The idea of distributing duty-free items early is 
very nice. I don't have to worry about it anymore. On ANA, they usually pass the preordered items in the last hour of 
flight. This made more sense for a flight that is only less than 500 miles and takes only over an hour from takeoff to 
touchdown.

<h2 id="inflight">Inflight</h2>
<p>We pushed back right on time and was in the air 15 minutes afterwards. The meal service is provided soon after reaching
the cruising altitude. For a flight that is only over an hour, the meal is beyond exception. The main dish is garlic chicken 
with rice, and there are also salad, fruits, and dessert. This is even better than some airlines' transpacific flight. However,
due to the short time of flight, there is no beverage service other than the orange juice in the tray. There are coffee and tea
served, though.</p>

<br />
<p>Due to the unique flight routes between Taiwan and mainland China, the flight took an S shape to reach Shanghai.
Nevertheless, we arrived into Pudong right on time.</p>

<h2 id="final">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>For such a short flight, the service provided in economy class is very nice. The lounge in Taipei is also excellent.
This is an airline that well worth the five stars rating, and well worth flying again.
