<em>The Sanrio Characters pillow</em></p>
<br />
<p>EVA Airways is a Taiwan-based airline found by Evergreen group, and a Star 
Alliance member. They are rated as 5-stars airline by Skytrax for a second 
consecutive year. Their Chicago route started in November 2016.</p>
<p>The Hello Kitty jet was arranged to the Chicago route three times a week 
since May 2017. Before that, this aircrafts mainly served Houston as its North 
American destination. Unfortunately, on the day I was travelling, there was a 
last-minute equipment change in Taipei, and the aircraft supposed to fly Chicago 
went to Bangkok instead. The last time similar thing occurred was in late 
February. It's hard to tell whether it's lucky or not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the service items are still Sanrio-branded. Regardless of the 
aircraft serving the route, these items will be available to announced routes 
and dates. </p>
<h2 id="checkin">Check-in and Lounge</h2>
<p>The journey starts with Sanrio-branded board at check-in counter. The 
boarding passes and luggage tags are also branded. I asked the agent whether 
everything apart from the aircraft itself will have Hello Kitty, and he said 
yes.</p>
<p class="img">
<img alt="Check-in sign. Note the Sanrio characters below" src="Articles/BR55/IMG_5487.jpg" width="600" /><br />
<em>The sign for priority check-in. Note the Sanrio characters below</em></p>
<p>While there should be a separated security line for business class 
passengers, it is not used at night. So all passengers have to queue in the same 
line. It is not extremely long, but definitely not impressive.</p>
<p>EVA Airways uses the Air France-KLM Lounge located near our boarding gate, 
Gate M7. The gate agent said we are able to board at the end of the lounge 
directly. This is impressive.</p>
<p class="img">
<img alt="The aircraft that would bring me home." src="Articles/BR55/IMG_5494.jpg" width="800" /><br />
<em>B-16719, the aircraft that will bring me home</em></p>
<p>This is not the first time I've visited this small lounge, and probably will 
not be the last time, since it accepts Priority Pass users in selected times as 
well.</p>
<h2 id="boarding">Boarding</h2>
<p>
The gate we were using was M7, and for lounge users, there is some sweet spot for 
this gate. Due to the unique location of the lounge, there is one exit on the end 
that goes straight to the boarding gate, and we can take advantage of that. Therefore, 
we were boarding directly from the lounge without going to the general waiting area.

After seated, I was greeted and started preparing for the flight. It took a significantly 
longer time to prepare for everything. During this time, I received the amenity kit 
(unfortunately not the famous Rimowa since it is no longer supplied for flights to Taipei), 
asked for the size of pajama and received it, asked for the choice of welcome drink and 
received it together with a Godiva chocolate, received the menu for flight and got the meals 
ordered. I also noticed that there are several passengers receiving a Hello Kitty themed
 tote bag and wasn’t sure about what that was for yet. It turned out to be the preordered 
 duty free items, which I realized after receiving it on my next flight to Shanghai (with 
 a non-Hello Kitty bag). With all these things coming in, it took over 30 minutes to settle 
 down everything. This process usually takes only 5 minutes, or even less in economy class.

<em> Taking off from Chicago. </em></p>

<p>The flight took off fairly on time, and the first meal was served soon after.</p>
<p>EVA Air provides online ordering service, which allows you to order meal ahead of time 
and get more unique choices. For this flight, I chose the "online special" lobster option</p>

<br />
<p class="img">

<em>Sweets: Fruit, Crunchy Chocolate and Black Cherry Tart</em></p>
<p>The wine list served is one of the best in the industry. EVA Air is bringing wines that usually 
served in First class into their business class, including the famous Krug Champagne. In fact, the 
Krug Rose served in this flight is even more expensive than Krug Brut found in those first-class cabins. 
Unfortunately, according to the menu in IFE, Krug is only served on Hello Kitty flights, and the option 
will be different in other days.</p>

<br />
<p>The beverages are also very nice. Almost all kinds of juice are tasty, and the tea list is also full of options. 
The water served is Evian and sparkling water is St’pelle***, those high-level options you could think of.</p>
<p class="img">
<img alt="Tea" SRC="Articles/BR55/IMG_5572.jpg" width="800" /><br />

<br />


<h2 id="inflight">Inflight</h2>
<p>After the meal, I had my mattress prepared, got a bottle of Fiji water, and went to some sleep. One thing I like 
for these midnight flights is that I can simply follow the normal sleeping time, and it is easier to get a good sleep. 
I was noticed by my friend that it is possible to see polar light in Canada. I stayed awake for a while and only barely 
see it. My camera seems to observe lights better, but not sure if this is polar light.</p>
<br />

<p>The restroom amenities are by Harnn, and are also Hello Kitty themed. Unfortunately, 
the toilet paper is no longer Hello Kitty themed.</p>

<p>I ordered some light meal during the flight. Most of time, I was sleeping well</p>

<h2 id="secondmeal">Second Meal and Arrival</h2>
<p>The next time I wake up, it is nearly time for the second meal. I chose the Chinese option 
with porridge (that you can add if you would like) and other things.</p>
<p class="img">
<img alt="secondtea" SRC="Articles/BR55/IMG_5598.jpg" width="600" /><br />
<em>The meal started with a TWG 1837 black tea</em></p>
<br />
<p class="img">

<em>Fill name here</em></p>
<p>I asked if I can take the menu away, and the answer is yes. I also asked for some other souvenir, and was 
presented with some playing cards. The other thing you can take with you is the pillow case, which I found 
exactly the same size as one of my pillows at home.</p>
<p class="img">

<p>Soon afterwards we started descending and arrived in Taipei ahead of time. We taxied to the gate and was 
soon off the plane after stopped. After the security in transfer areas, I went for the EVA Air lounge, which 
will be in my next report.</p>

<h2 id="final">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The EVA Airways Royal Laurel class is definitely worth it, especially for award trips. It could even be the 
best business class options over the Pacific. While there are something surprised in this flight (non-Hello Kitty 
aircraft and the amenity kit), it is still very nice. Hopefully the returning flight from Taipei would have 
everything I want to see.
