<p>I have been recording my flight history 
since 2014, when I started to have a bit of interest with civil aviation. It 
took a while for me to find the older flights I’ve taken before 2013, since I’m 
not old enough at that time to realize the importance of keeping the records. If 
anyone has suggestions about tools to find out aircraft type / schedule for 
those old flights, please let me know :) Fortunately, I have 
included all of my flights I’ve ever taken. Every flight since 2014 has been 
recorded properly. You can check a concise version of my flight history by 
<a href="flight_history.html">Clicking Here</a>.</p>
<p>So far, these records are staying in a 
spreadsheet, and to be honest, I’m not sure what I can do with them. One great 
service I found is <a href="https://openflights.org">OpenFlights.org</a>. This is an open source service that can keep 
your flight history and provide some analysis / visualizations, including a nice 
route map. Here’s what I’ve got.</p>
<p class="img"><a href='https://openflights.org/user/F1Mider' target='_blank'><img src='https://openflights.org/banner/F1Mider.png' width=400 height=70></a></p>
<p>Another service I’m using is 
<a href="https://www.flightmemory.com">Flightmemory.com</a>. This also gives some great maps and statistics, but to be honest, 
I prefer openflights which allows me to import flight data using csv file, which 
can be transferred easily from my spreadsheet. For Flightmemory, you have to 
type in everything. I was so boring on one day that I decided to manually input 
everything in there.</p>
<p class="img"><a href="https://my.flightmemory.com/F1Mider"><img src="https://my.flightmemory.com/image/F1Mider.gif"></a></p>
<p>Still, both services are not flexible 
enough for me to learn something more advanced. For example, the actual carrier 
(considering the regional carriers as an actual carrier rather than United 
Express flight) vs the ticketing carrier (considering United Express as United 
flights. I’m actually struggled to name this thing because it’s not exactly 
ticketing carrier since there are codeshare flights as well, and I’m only 
considering the actual carrier. Naming suggestion is welcome). The aircraft type 
is also quite annoying since the type I kept record is way too specific. It’s 
not easy to use either service to fulfill the two different levels of details in 
aircraft types. Therefore, I decided to use this dataset as a final project for 
my data visualization class using Python.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first diagram that you might want to 
see (or I assume you want to see) is still that route map. Therefore, we did 
one. I know it’s not perfect, but at least it shows something.</p>
<p class="img"><img class="graph" alt="Route Map" src="Statistics/map.png" /></p>
<p>We also made an interactive version, but 
unfortunately with the current technology it’s impossible for us to allow you to 
interact with it without a server that does all the calculations each time you 
select on something. If you are curious about hot it looks like, you can <a href="interactive.html">click here</a>. 
Therefore, I have a few quick videos on how it looks like.</p>
<p>You can filter either airlines (using 
the ticketing carrier I mentioned earlier), city (both departure and arrival), 
and aircraft type. These three videos shows the filter of each of them.</p>

</p>
<p>The filters can also be used together. 
For example, Delta Air Lines holds a huge number of MD-88 in their home base 
Atlanta. This video shows all the flights I’ve taken to/from Atlanta on a 
MD-80/90/717 series with Delta with all three filters.</p>

<p>If you happened to have access to 
Jupyterhub, you may want to run my notebook within there to play with it. Sadly, 
it won’t work with any other services like nbviewer, since they are only for 
static pictures. <a href="https://github.com/F1Mider/flights">Click here for source code on GitHub</a></p>
<p>As I said earlier, airlines and 
aircrafts are two parts that could be quite different with different detail 
levels. To compare the differences of these detail levels, we created several 
graphs. The first set is for airlines.</p>
<p class="img"><img class="sidebyside" alt="Actual carrier" src="Statistics/actualcarrier.png" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img class="sidebyside" alt="Ticketing carrier" src="Statistics/ticketingcarrier.png" /></p>
<p>With ticketing carrier, Delta and United have significantly more flights, which 
boosted them to the first and second. When excluding those regional flights by 
United Express and Delta Connections, Air China, All Nippon Airways, and Delta 
shares the greatest count.</p>
<p>However, it might be a different story 
in terms of flight durations and mileage for all airlines. For this part, we 
have two more graphs.</p>
<p class="img"><img class="sidebyside" alt="Airline vs Mileage" src="Statistics/mileage.png" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img class="sidebyside" alt="Airline vs Duration" src="Statistics/duration.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, Asiana Airlines has the 
greatest duration and mileage since I had several transpacific flights with 
them, which isn’t a lot with just flight count.</p>
<p>A similar approach is used for 
aircrafts, and there are two more graphs regarding flight count.</p>
<p class="img"><img class="sidebyside" alt="General aircraft type" src="Statistics/aircrafttype.png" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img class="sidebyside" alt="Detailed aircraft type" src="Statistics/detailedtype.png" /></p>
<p>In both cases, Airbus A320 (family) is dominant, but 
the effect is more significant in the “midfield” like ERJs and CRJs. By 
combining the counts of all variations of these regional jets, their count 
exceeds those jumbo jets like Boeing 747 and Airbus A380.</p>
<p>Again, the similar approach is used on 
airports and cities (regardless of departure or arrival), and again, we have two 
more graphs regarding flight count.</p>
<p class="img"><img class="sidebyside" alt="Airport count" src="Statistics/airport.png" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img class="sidebyside" alt="City count" src="Statistics/city.png" /></p>
<p>Similarly, the dominant ones stayed the 
same, especially Shanghai since that is my hometown, and Chicago, which is 
closest to my home in the US. However, since Indianapolis is also an option for 
me in the US, it took away some trips that could start from Chicago as well. For 
Shanghai, though, it’s almost guaranteed to depart from one of the two airports 
for any trip. In the “midfield”, Washington DC, New York (including Newark), and 
Taipei are having greater counts since there are multiple airports in all these 
cities with a few flights in each of them.</p>
<p>Our latest graph so far is finding the 
relationship between duration and mileage, which you would expect a longer 
flight results a longer duration. However, there are some interesting findings 
beyond this.</p>
<p class="img"><img class="graph" alt="Mileage vs Duration" src="Statistics/mileageduration.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the points tend to be on 
the top right or bottom left, which are very long flights and rather short 
flights. There aren’t many flights in the middle (around 5000-9000km). This is 
related to the data itself, which is indeed my flight history. Most of my 
flights are either domestic / same region (like within East Asia), or they are 
transpacific. I have barely taken any mid-range flights like from North America 
to Europe or from East Asia to Europe. That how this gap is produced.</p>

<p>The airport longitude and latitude data are retrieved from <a href="https://openflights.org/data.html">openflights database</a>.</p>
